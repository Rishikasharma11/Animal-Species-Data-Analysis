Animal Species Data Analysis
This project is focused on analyzing various animal species based on their characteristics such as habitat, lifespan, weight, and more. By leveraging Pandas and NumPy, this project allows for in-depth analysis and insights into the biodiversity and conservation status of different species, while providing an interactive platform for users to explore these datasets.

Features:
Species Data Analysis: Perform comprehensive analysis on animal species, covering aspects like habitat, conservation status, lifespan, and weight distribution.
Diet Classification: Categorize animals based on their food habits, including carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores, for better understanding of dietary patterns.
Human Interaction Levels: Analyze species based on their interaction with humans, such as high, medium, and low, providing insights into human-animal relationships.
Interactive Species Lookup: Use user input to filter species by region or check their population statistics.
Technologies:
Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data processing, manipulation, and statistical analysis of the animal dataset.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Create detailed visualizations like bar charts and graphs to represent species data, providing clear insights into the analysis.
Streamlit (optional for UI): An interactive user interface for querying species information, visualizing data trends, and allowing dynamic user interaction.
